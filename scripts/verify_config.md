# Configuration Verification Script

## Manual Verification Steps

Since flutter/dart commands are not available in this environment, here are the steps to verify the implementation:

### 1. Dart Analysis
```bash
dart analyze
```
Expected: No analysis issues

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
dart test test/config/environment_test.dart
```
Expected: All tests pass

### 3. Run Dev Flavor
```bash
flutter run --flavor dev --dart-define=FLAVOR=development
```
Expected: 
- App launches with "Monica Dev" name
- Environment screen shows development configuration
- Feature flags are correctly set for dev environment

### 4. Build Dev APK
```bash
flutter build apk --flavor dev --dart-define=FLAVOR=development
```
Expected: APK builds successfully with dev configuration

**Note**: The project is configured with:
- Gradle 8.9 (meets Flutter requirements)
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.6.0 (meets Flutter requirements)
- Kotlin 2.1.0 (meets Flutter requirements)
- BuildConfig feature enabled for custom build fields
- Default Android debug signing (no custom keystore needed)

### 5. Verify App Manifest
Check that `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` references `@string/app_name`

### 6. Verify Gradle Configuration
Check that `android/app/build.gradle` has the dev flavor configured correctly

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `lib/config/feature_flags.dart` - Feature flags system
- `lib/main.dart` - Main app entry point with environment display
- `test/config/environment_test.dart` - Environment configuration tests
- `android/` directory structure - Complete Android project setup
- `docs/FLAVORS.md` - Documentation for flavor system

### Modified Files:
- `lib/core/config/environment.dart` - Enhanced with API URLs and app names
- `lib/core/config/app_config.dart` - Updated to use environment configuration

## Architecture Readiness

The implementation is ready for:
1. ✅ Dev environment usage
2. ✅ Easy addition of staging/prod flavors
3. ✅ API endpoint configuration
4. ✅ Feature flag management
5. ✅ Build-time configuration

## Next Steps

When ready to add more flavors:
1. Uncomment staging/prod flavors in `android/app/build.gradle`
2. Test build commands for each flavor
3. Configure production signing keys
